## [0.1.0] - 09-10-2024

First version of the Titus CLI Released

### Added

- Basic functionality of the CLI: Distributed as a Python package and installed as a standalone command (`titus`) for the system, it initializes a Titus frontend project by creating the necessary CSS files. For the moments, these files are a `reset.css` and the `titus-system.css` file with all the variables. The program will build the system according to the user's input: a main color for the project and a border radius.
